# DataScience-ML-project
This is the term project for Introduction to Data Science course, CS210, in SabancÄ± University.

In this project we took two sets of data from online source DataSF; drug-related crime data and school data of San Francisco.

https://data.sfgov.org/Economy-and-Community/Map-of-Schools/qb37-w9se

Through using ML techniques of python scikit-learn; Decision Tree Learning, Naive Bayes and Neural Networks, we performed classification using these data sets.
We've demonstrated how combining these data sets improved our predictions. More information about the project can be found on our blog; https://cs210group42.wordpress.com/

This code can serve as a introduction to how to manipulate and pre-process data in python, how to prepare this data for certain ML techniques and implementation examples for ML.
